            "Hi, I’m Will, a student in Year 12 studying Maths, Further Maths, Physics and ICT. I have been learning how to program in 2009 with VB.Net and have eventually learnt HTML, CSS, JavaScript and C# over the years.",
            "The main thing I want to get out of this course is to try and learn a new programming language (in this case, Python) as well as to meet some likeminded people who are interested in computer science. I have done very little work in Python before (basically “Hello world!” and a few simple if statements), but apparently it is one of the main languages being taught in schools today.",
            "The languages we got to choose from are: PHP, Python, Ruby, Java and JavaScript. As I have plenty of experience in PHP, I chose to learn Python because I have both heard of it before and know that it should be good for web development. People using Java will not have the easiest time on earth in my opinion because of the age and nature of the language (in fact, it is one of the two languages I hate to work with, the other being VB.Net due to the syntax and the fact that you have to make sure the S on Sub is a capital, but it is still a good language to start learning how to program)."
